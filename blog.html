                <b style="font-size: large;">Plants with glossy, dark green oval leaves that narrow to a point. <br>
            The leaves rise directly from the soil. <br>

            <h2>Hydrangea</h2>
            <p>
                <b style="font-size: large;"> Shade-loving shrub that can produce ball-shaped flower clusters <br>
                or flat clusters of small flowers. <br>
                very popular both as cut flowers and plants for the garden because of their big, beautiful blooms. <br>
                The large flowerheads look like pom poms growing on bushes that can get as tall as trees. <br>
                Colors range from white to pink, blue, or purple flowers, depending on the soil's acidity.</b>

            <h2>Bougainvillea</h2>
            <P>
                <b style="font-size: large;"> Grows as a woody vine or shrub, reaching 4.6 to 12.2 m <br>
                with heart-shaped leaves and thorny, pubescent stems. <br>
                The flowers are generally small, white, and inconspicuous, <br>
                highlighted by several brightly colored modified leaves called bracts. <br>
                Bougainvillea is by nature a vigorous and chaotic plant that produces <br>
                long, trailing stems covered in sharp spines. <br>
                It can be grown as a climber or pruned into a free-standing shrub.</b>
